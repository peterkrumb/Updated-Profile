## Thoughts
I remember when doing the first homework assignment was pretty overwhelming and scary, but I did get it down, then the second one was equally as difficult. I think to how far I've come along with the styling elements, and while I have work to do on the various elements of JavaScript, I feel pretty confident on HTML, CSS and styling pages now.

## Case studies
There were a couple of theories I've come across from listening to various YouTubers and one of them was to do case studies on your projects in your professional portfolio. This way you can talk about them and really go in-depth on the thought process of what you went through doing the project or assignment, showing potential employers essentially that you know what you're talking about. If I could spend more time on this project I would go through each of my assignments and thoroughly describe my thought process.

## Few tweaks
Another idea I came across from YouTuber Josh Fluke was to not put a contact form on your website, but to rather just put your e-mail and let people e-mail you.
