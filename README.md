## Case studies
There were a couple of theories I've come across from listening to various YouTubers and one of them was to do case studies on your projects in your professional portfolio. This way you can talk about them and really go in-depth on the thought process of what you went through doing the project or assignment, showing potential employers essentially that you know what you're talking about.
-What you felt before going into that project
-What was your knowledge and skill level before going into that project
-What kind of misconceptions did you have before going into that project
-During that project what did you do, what epiphanies did you have
-After the project, what did you learn

## Few tweaks
Another idea I came across was to not put a contact form on your website, but to rather just put your e-mail and let people e-mail you.
